# Planet Hunter TESS eclipsing binary tags statistics

## Goals:

- Gauge how accurate #eclipsingbinary tags are, by comparing tagged TICs with various variable star catalogs.
- Produce a list of new eclipsing binary candidates that are not in existing catalogs.


## Preliminary Results

- Based on a sample of 2000 subjects across sectors 1 -26, with 1448 unique TICs matching against [SIMBAD](http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/) data..
- If we consider the TICs of which the TIC is tagged by 2 or more users in a sector (**733 TICs**),
- The accuracy of the tagging is upward to **80%**.
- There could have upward about **330 new eclipsing binaries** that have not been previously classified so in SIMBAD.
